# ContactListProject
Repository for Contact List Java Project.


Hello, this is my first Java Project with graphical UI!
So what is this project? It's basically a simple contact list that you can have on your computer and store people's phone numbers.

The program gives you plenty of posibilities:

 - naturally you can add, edit or delete contacts
 - set contacts to important/highlighted (which makes their font bold and puts them at the top of the list)
 - the program automatically sorts contacts for you in alphabetical order, but it first sorts the highlighted contacts and then it adds sorted unhighlighted contacts below.
 - you can choose three display options:
    - 1. display all contacts
    - 2. display only highlighted contacts
    - 3. display only unhighlighted contacts
 - you can see the statistics - how many contacts do you have and also how many highlighted contacts do you have
 - it saves all contacts to database.txt file, if it doesn't exist, it will create an empty file.




How to use this program:

 - you can click at contact with right mouse button and delete/edit contact
 - add, delete, highlight, unhighlight contacts by usuing buttons at the left bottom of the screen
 - pick radiobutton at the top which changes what contacts will be displayed in the list
 - if you select contact, you can press 'DELETE' on your keyboard and it will proceed to delete the contact.
 - at the top right corner, there is a button to close the program. Of course you can do it manually, but it's safer to do it by the button. It actually asures you that all the contacts you've created will surely be saved to the file.



!!! ALL THE DATA IS SAVED TO "database.txt" FILE.
